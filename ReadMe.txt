What Is This?
-------------

This is set of classes is intended to provide production ready application for the problems given.


Where to find the implementation for the given problems?
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Write a function that reverses the order of words of a sentence: "ReverseWords.cs"

2. Create your own class or a set of functions that implement a stack. Include the following four methods: "MyStack.cs"
	a. Push: Adds a data element to the top of the stack
	b. Pop: Removes a data element from the top of the stack
	c. Size: Returns the total number of elements in the stack
	d. isEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty.

3. Write a function f(a, b) which takes two character string arguments and returns a string containing only the characters found in both strings.: "CommonCharacters.cs"

How to run this three different problems:
In the "program.cs, we have to uncomment the code which we want to see the output.

(For E.g.) if I want to see the output for reverse the order of the order I do the following as shown below,

	/*Uncomment below code to execute "Reverse the order of words of a sentense" problem */
    ReverseWords.InputString();

    /*Uncomment below code to execute "Stack" problem */
    //StackTest.main();

    /*Uncomment below code to execute "Common Characters found in both strings" problem */
    //CommonCharacters.InputString();
